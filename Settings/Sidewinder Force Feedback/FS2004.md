 Possible Fix: Microsoft Force Feedback 2 Joystick and the self center force disabling

Microsoft Force Feedback 2 Joystick working with Window 8.1 Driver that comes built in.

games that has support for Force Feedback will disable the Self Centering Feature of the stick and makes it go limp.


    I fixed it by disabling direct input from detecting that the stick is Force Feedback capable.

    Basically, with RegEdit,

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER/System/CurrentControlSet/Control/MediaProperties/PrivateProperties/Joystick/OEM/VID_045E&PID_001B/OEMForceFeedback

    I change the above keys permission to EVERYONE - {"Full Control","Read"} - DENY . Now when I run dxdiag, the stick is not detected as Force Feedback capable anymore and X3TC runs without making the stick go limp. Before making the permission change, DXDIAG had a value for the Force Feedback Driver, now it's "n/a".
